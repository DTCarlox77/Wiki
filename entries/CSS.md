# CSS

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation and layout of a document written in HTML or XML. CSS enhances the visual presentation of web pages by allowing developers to control the appearance of elements on a webpage.

## Key Features:

- **Selectors and Rules:** CSS uses selectors to target HTML elements and rules to define the styling properties of those elements. A rule consists of a selector and a declaration block.

- **Box Model:** The CSS box model describes the layout and design of elements on a webpage. It includes properties for margins, borders, padding, and the content area.

- **Responsive Design:** CSS supports responsive design through media queries, allowing developers to apply different styles based on the characteristics of the device or viewport size.

- **Flexbox and Grid Layout:** CSS provides powerful layout mechanisms like Flexbox and Grid Layout, making it easier to create complex and responsive page layouts.

- **Transitions and Animations:** CSS enables the creation of smooth transitions and animations, enhancing the user experience by adding dynamic visual effects.

- **Typography:** CSS allows control over fonts, sizes, spacing, and other typography-related properties, contributing to the overall design aesthetics.

- **Colors and Gradients:** CSS provides a variety of ways to define colors, including named colors, hexadecimal values, RGB, and HSL. Gradients can be used to create smooth color transitions.

- **Selectors for States:** CSS includes pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements to select and style elements based on their state or position, such as `:hover` or `::before`.

- **Vendor Prefixes:** In dealing with browser compatibility, CSS supports vendor prefixes for experimental or non-standard properties. This ensures that properties work across different browsers.
