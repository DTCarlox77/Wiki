# Django


[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern and is designed to make it easy to build web applications by providing reusable code for common tasks.

## Features:

- **ORM (Object-Relational Mapping):** Django comes with a powerful Object-Relational Mapping system that allows developers to interact with databases using Python objects.

- **Admin Interface:** Django provides a built-in admin interface for managing database records, making it easy to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

- **URL Routing:** The framework includes a flexible URL routing system that allows developers to map URLs to Python views.

- **Template System:** Django comes with a template system that enables the separation of HTML code from Python code, promoting a clean and maintainable structure.

- **Middleware Support:** Django's middleware support allows developers to process requests globally before reaching the views, enabling functionalities such as authentication and security checks.

- **Authentication and Authorization:** Django provides built-in tools for handling user authentication and authorization, making it easier to implement secure user access.

- **Form Handling:** The framework simplifies form handling by providing tools to validate and process form data, reducing the boilerplate code required for form submissions.

- **Security:** Django includes built-in security features to protect against common web application vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).

- **Scalability:** Django is designed to scale horizontally, making it suitable for building applications that can handle a large number of users.

## Getting Started:

To start a new Django project, you can use the following command:

```bash
django-admin startproject projectname
```

This will create a new Django project with the default directory structure.
