# HTML

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating and designing web pages. It forms the backbone of web content by providing the structure and organization of information. HTML uses a tag-based system to define elements on a page, and these elements can include text, images, links, forms, and more.

## Key Features:

- **Markup Structure:** HTML uses a markup structure consisting of elements enclosed in tags to define the different parts of a web page.

- **Elements and Tags:** Elements represent the building blocks of HTML, and tags are used to define and enclose these elements. Tags are often in pairs, with an opening tag and a closing tag.

- **Document Structure:** HTML documents have a standard structure, including `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` elements. The head typically contains meta-information, while the body contains the main content.

- **Semantic Elements:** HTML includes semantic elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<footer>`, and `<article>`, providing meaning to the structure and improving accessibility.

- **Hyperlinks:** The `<a>` (anchor) tag is used to create hyperlinks, allowing navigation between different pages and resources on the web.

- **Lists:** HTML supports ordered `<ol>` and unordered `<ul>` lists, as well as definition lists `<dl>`, providing flexibility for organizing information.

- **Forms:** The `<form>` element allows the creation of input forms for user interaction, with various input types such as text fields, checkboxes, and radio buttons.

- **Images:** The `<img>` tag is used to embed images into web pages, enhancing visual content.
