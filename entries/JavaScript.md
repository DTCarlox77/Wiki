JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language primarily known for its role in building dynamic and interactive web pages. As a client-side scripting language, JavaScript runs in web browsers, allowing developers to create engaging user interfaces and enhance the overall user experience.

## Key Features:

- **Dynamic Typing:** JavaScript is dynamically typed, allowing variables to change types during runtime, providing flexibility in coding.

- **Event-Driven Programming:** JavaScript enables event-driven programming, responding to user actions (clicks, keypresses) and updating the content dynamically.

- **DOM Manipulation:** The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. JavaScript allows developers to manipulate the DOM, changing content, structure, and styles.

- **Asynchronous Operations:** JavaScript supports asynchronous programming using callbacks, promises, and async/await, facilitating non-blocking code execution and improved performance.

- **Functions as First-Class Citizens:** Functions in JavaScript are first-class citizens, meaning they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned as values.

- **Prototypal Inheritance:** JavaScript uses prototypal inheritance, allowing objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects, promoting code reusability.

- **Closures:** Closures in JavaScript allow functions to retain access to variables in their lexical scope even after the scope has finished executing, providing encapsulation and data privacy.

- **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** JavaScript is supported by all major web browsers, ensuring cross-browser compatibility for web applications.

- **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation):** JavaScript supports JSON, a lightweight data interchange format widely used for data exchange between a server and a web application.
